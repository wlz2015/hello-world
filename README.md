# hello-world
Go from the ground
Someone asked me to write some thing here and close this issue.
This line is typed from the branch readmeedit, it is typed for practice.
I input this line with the eyes closed. In such process, I still need to think about each keys position on the keyboard. Because I losted the adjacent envrionment.
And I have to output words in my closed eyes. However, the mechanic keyboard, offer me a better tool, if my enlish is not bad. 
If I have a flow of sentance, the typing process is fast. But if I have to think about each words form, the letters in them. Then the speed will be dropped pretyy large.
